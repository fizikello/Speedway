# Speedway
A fast-paced 2D speedway racing game built with Pygame, supporting local multiplayer for up to 4 players. Inspired by real speedway racing, each player controls their motorcycle with simple three-key input (left, right, gas), competing to react fastest to the green light and master the elliptical track.
